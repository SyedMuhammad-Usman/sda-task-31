# Software Architecture Challenges and Solutions

This repository explores common challenges faced in software architecture and provides solutions using practical examples. It includes scenarios, architectural problems, and a detailed Java-based solution for one of the issues.


## Overview

Software architecture is critical in designing scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications. This repository identifies real-world architectural problems and demonstrates how to address them.

## Identified Problems in Software Architecture

### 1. **Scalability Challenges**
- **Scenario:** Social media platforms like Twitter experience traffic surges during global events.
- **Problem:** Monolithic systems fail to handle sudden increases in user demand.
- **Solution:** Migrate to microservices architecture to distribute load effectively.

### 2. **Microservices Complexity**
- **Scenario:** Video streaming platforms like Netflix.
- **Problem:** Complex inter-service communication and debugging.
- **Solution:** Implement observability tools and use resilient communication protocols.

### 3. **Security and Privacy**
- **Scenario:** Healthcare systems like IBM Watson Health.
- **Problem:** Handling sensitive data without compromising security.
- **Solution:** Enforce data encryption and access controls.

### 4. **Integration with Legacy Systems**
- **Scenario:** Banking applications using legacy systems (e.g., COBOL mainframes).
- **Problem:** Legacy systems lack modern APIs and cannot integrate with new applications.
- **Solution:** Use middleware to bridge the gap. (Detailed solution below)

### 5. **Sustainability in Software Development**
- **Scenario:** Large-scale cloud platforms like AWS.
- **Problem:** High energy consumption leads to unsustainable operations.
- **Solution:** Optimize resource usage and adopt energy-efficient architectures.

## Solution for Legacy System Integration

### Problem Description
Legacy systems often lack modern integration methods like APIs. This creates challenges for modern applications requiring data in structured formats like JSON.

### Solution Overview
Middleware acts as a bridge between the legacy system and the modern application:
- Fetches data from the legacy system.
- Converts data into a JSON format.
- Serves it to the modern application.

### Code Implementation
The implementation uses Java. Below are the key components:
- **LegacySystem.java**: Simulates a legacy system.
- **Middleware.java**: Converts legacy data into JSON.
- **BankingApp.java**: Modern application that consumes data from the middleware.
